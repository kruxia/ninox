## Publishing and Learning Ecosystem

Ninox = Software Platform for Writing, Publishing, Reading, Learning

### MVP

What is the simplest version of this entire stack that I could build and make a profitable place to publish content?

* Authors can write, edit, and publish their own writing.
    * Write and edit: Word (import), Markdown (import), X(HT)ML (editing component)
    * Publish:
        - Title
        - Body
        - Publication date/time (maybe future)
        - License (commercial, CC-*, public domain)
        - Price
        - Language
        - Sharing policy: Whole or preview.
    * Landing page lists their publications.
    * Bio, photo
    * Withdraw funds
* Readers can browse, purchase, tip, and read writing.
    * Browse authors and their writing
    * Search titles and content
    * Deposit funds
    * Purchase content
